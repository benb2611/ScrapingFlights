# ScrapingFlights 🚀 ✈️ 🚁 

ScrapingFlights is the project, where I created codes which scrap information about flights, such as: departure, destianation,
price, tax, number of flights, in conclusion a lot of information. The data is saved in csv, the example output is in folder 
"Example output". 
To this project I used tools such as Selenium, Webdriver, Beautifulsoup, Request and codes was created in Python.

#Iberia, Binter, Ryanair, Norwegian
The codes were made by Selenium, Webdriver. The codes use a lot of Selenium's library tools, such as clicking on object,
scrolling to object, switching between the cards.

#Flybe
Flybe use only request, I find api in "Developer tools" and it scraps api of this web. 

#Kayak
It is the code where it changes proxy and gives fake user agent for cheating REcaptcha. The code is effective in 75% situations.
Everything is for free beacuse it scraps other websides with fake agent and proxy data. 
The code save in txt file. 
The code took me a lot of effort to create, because it scraps three website in one code and one time.
